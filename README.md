Getting Started With Redux
======

Letâ€™s learn Redux! This repo is just a binder for my annotated code from [Getting Started With Redux](https://egghead.io/series/getting-started-with-redux) by [Dan Abramov](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov).

If you happen to stumble upon this, maybe the notes will be helpful. That said, this is basically a repo because I was too lazy to write each file as a Gist.
